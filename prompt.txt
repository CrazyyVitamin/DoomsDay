Context:I want to build a web-based typing shooter game similar to ZTy.pe rename it "Type Check".
Tech Stack:
 • Language: HTML5, CSS3, and Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+).
 • Rendering: HTML5 Canvas API (Context 2D).
 • No external game frameworks (keep it lightweight and dependency-free).
Game Mechanics:
 1. Player: A stationary ship at the bottom center of the screen.
 2. Enemies: Ships that spawn at the top of the screen and slowly move down toward the player.
 3. Words: Each enemy has a random word assigned to it, displayed above the enemy ship.
 4. Targeting System:
 ◦ The player cannot manually aim.
 ◦ When the player types a letter, the game checks if that letter matches the start of any active enemy's word.
 ◦ Lock-on: Once a letter is typed that matches an enemy, that enemy becomes the "Locked Target".
 ◦ The player must finish typing the current word to destroy the locked enemy.
 ◦ Other enemies cannot be targeted until the locked enemy is destroyed or the word is completed.
 5. Shooting:
 ◦ Every correct keystroke fires a plasma bullet from the player ship to the locked enemy.
 ◦ Completing the word destroys the enemy with a particle explosion effect.
 6. Game Over: If an enemy touches the player ship, the game ends.
Visual Style:
 • Background: Dark space theme.
 • Style: Wireframe or Neon aesthetic (green/red colors).
 • Smooth animations (60fps game loop using requestAnimationFrame).
Task:Write the complete, single-file HTML/JS code (index.html) to play this game. Include the word list array, the game loop, class structures for Enemy, Bullet, and Particle, and the event listener for keystrokes.
 
Key Implementation Details to Look For
ensure it handles the "Lock-on" logic correctly. The code must prevent the player from typing the first letter of another word while they are already halfway through typing the current word.
